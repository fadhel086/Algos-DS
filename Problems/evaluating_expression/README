The excercise takes an expression in infix-notation and converts to post-fix for evaluation.
Expression is entered as 111 + 222 * 64 / 6.
Invalid expression will result in garbage.

TOBE DONE:
* Handle brackets.
* Use string library functions to parse operators and operands while expression evaluation.
* Re-write the code, to focus more on DATA, rather than on logic.
